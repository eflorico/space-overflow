The Stack trilogy consists of several programming or technical Q/A sites, like stackoverflow.com, serverfault.com and superuser.com.

There are a lot of interesting questions in the Stack Trilogy. But it is difficult to find your way through the huge amount of content when the only way to browse through it is lists. SpaceOverflow lets you capture the content on the Stack trilogy in a whole new way: Questions are visualized in 3D space! The closer a question is, the newer it is. The further it is in the center, the more votes does it have. Zoom with your mouse wheel, and pan by dragging. When you click on a question, a browser is opened that gives you all possibilities that you have when you regularly visit a Stack site.
